## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a **liquidity-pool-manager** (LPM) integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: What is a Liquidity-Pool-Manager (LPM)?

In this context, a Liquidity-Pool-Manager is not a single public software but a **category of software or a proprietary system** used by trading firms, hedge funds, and decentralized protocols to manage capital across multiple venues. Its primary functions are:

1.  **Capital Allocation:** Distributing funds across various exchanges and trading pairs to maximize returns.

3.  **Risk Management:** Monitoring exposure, rebalancing portfolios, and executing trades to maintain a desired state.
4.  **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage:** Exploiting tiny price differences for the same asset on different exchanges.

To perform these functions, the LPM *must* integrate seamlessly with exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
